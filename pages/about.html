            Hey guys, so you want me to know more about me right lets get started. I was studied till 10th standard as a normal student but I had some health issue and it made me loose what I like.
            So after 10 th I took mobile servicing course and it was completed in almost 10 months. After 2 months I got my first job as trainee so I worked there almost 2 months. After that I got another job in different shop i worked only for 1 week its kind on less salary so I quit. After some weeks I found another job and the salary was good enough and good work atmosphere. Later the job life was too tight shedule and also I have some thing going on my mind I am not belonged here I wamted a high income job tha was my turning pont.

Beacuse of open schooling I had enough time at that time I started watching coding related video becaue since I was child I had very intrest in technology.
